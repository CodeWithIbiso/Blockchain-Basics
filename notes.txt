Dapp - decentralised application
Decentralised protocol - smart contract


Dapp is usually a combination of many smart contracts

The pinky swear

Scratch card

Immutable transparent  decentralised

Flamingo

Defi - decentralised finance

Trust minimised agreements

========
1. Set up wallet using META-MASK - 42
    1. Mnemonics 
    2. etherscan.io
    3. Your private key - should not be shared
    4. Ethereum mainet and Ethereum testate -48
    5. Rinkby and Kovan eg rinkby etherscan
    6. Faucet - 51 eg faucets.chain.link
    7. Gas - unit of computational measurement
    8. Gas lower limit * gas price = transactional fee
2. Hash is unique fixed length of string used to identify data. Created by putting data in hash function
    1. Block,nonce and data to produce hash starting with 4 zeros - Andersbrownworth.com
    2. Genesis block - first block in blockchain. Distributed is decentralised 
    3. Hash, block, blockchain, distributed, tokens,
    4. Sign transaction, create public key from private key and last digit of public key is your address
    5. Proof of work - miners
    6. Proof of stake - validators
    7. Try running a node when u become an expert
3. Remix - contracts
    1. Each executed smart contract has an address
    2. View and pure does not require gas to execute cause view just reads while pure doesnâ€™t do anything with the variables defined . Transaction are made when modifying state
    3. Store data in solidity - stack,memory,storage,calldata,code,logs - string as memory since its array when passed as function param
    4. To deploy - Injected web3 - docs.chain.link/docs/link-token-contracts/ 2:55
    5. Composability - contracts interacting with other contracts
